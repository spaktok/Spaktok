# Spaktok Evolution Report v2.0

Date: 2025-10-14

## Executive Summary
- Unified backend entrypoint to `server_enhanced.js` with secure Firebase Admin initialization supporting environment-based credentials and ADC fallback.
- Resolved merge conflicts across backend and frontend, restored deterministic builds.
- Standardized docker-compose for local stack (frontend Flutter web, backend API, Redis, optional Mongo/Postgres).
- Fixed Flutter frontend package naming and imports; added minimal `ChatMessage` model; stabilized `main.dart` navigation.
- Added `routes/api.js` aggregator to consolidate API routing.

## Backend Changes
- package.json: set main to `server_enhanced.js`, harmonized dependencies and scripts.
- server_enhanced.js: env-based Firebase credentials (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`), safe fallback; route stubbing for missing aggregators; caching and Socket.IO preserved.
- docker-compose.yml: cleaned conflicts; coherent ports; Redis required; Mongo/Postgres optional.
- routes/api.js: new aggregator mounting `streaming`, `auth`, `battle-gifting`, `payment` when present.

## Frontend (Flutter Web) Changes
- pubspec.yaml: resolved conflicts; package name `spaktok_frontend`; aligned dependencies for Firebase v6 and AI/RTC features.
- main.dart: resolved conflicts; consistent bottom navigation with existing screens.
- models/chat_message.dart: new lightweight model with Firestore serialization.

## Security & Privacy
- Removed hard dependency on local service account; prefer env/ADC.
- CORS default `*` only for local dev; override via `CORS_ORIGIN` in prod.
- Rate limiting and Helmet enabled in backend.

## Readiness Checklist
- Backend starts via Node 22 Alpine, healthcheck `/health`.
- Redis connectivity required (compose provides it).
- Frontend builds inside container via Flutter 3.35.x (`frontend/Dockerfile`).
- No unresolved merge markers; docker-compose resolves successfully.

## Next Up (Post-v2.0)
- E2EE chat v1 (Signal protocol) integration.
- Live SFU (LiveKit) + HLS VOD pipeline and edge caching.
- Advanced moderation (media/text) and abuse heuristics.
- Open API (rate-limited) and developer tools.
