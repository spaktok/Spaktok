## Feature-Specific Battery Optimization Strategies

### 1. Advanced Media Processing (VisionAI)

Media processing, particularly real-time video processing with AI, is one of the most power-intensive operations in Spaktok. The following strategies are employed to minimize battery consumption:

#### On-Device ML Model Optimization

- **Model Quantization:** All on-device machine learning models (for face detection, object detection, scene classification, etc.) are quantized to reduce their size and computational cost. Quantization converts model weights from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers, significantly reducing memory bandwidth and improving inference speed with minimal accuracy loss.

- **Model Pruning:** Unnecessary connections and neurons are removed from ML models through pruning, further reducing model size and computational cost.

- **Hardware Acceleration:** All ML inference is performed using hardware accelerators (GPU, Neural Engine on iOS, Neural Networks API on Android) to maximize efficiency and minimize CPU usage.

- **Adaptive Model Selection:** Different models with varying levels of complexity are available. The system automatically selects the most appropriate model based on device capabilities and battery level. For example, on low battery, a simpler, faster model is used instead of a more accurate but computationally expensive model.

#### Selective Processing

- **Process Only Visible Frames:** During real-time preview, only the frames that are currently visible to the user are processed. Frames that are off-screen or obscured are skipped.

- **Reduce Processing Resolution:** For real-time preview, video is processed at a lower resolution (e.g., 720p) than the final output resolution (e.g., 4K). This significantly reduces the computational cost while maintaining acceptable visual quality for preview purposes.

- **Frame Skipping:** On low battery or when the device is overheating, the system skips frames during processing, reducing the processing load at the cost of slightly lower frame rates.

#### GPU Optimization

- **Efficient Shader Code:** All shader programs used for visual effects are optimized for efficiency, minimizing the number of instructions and memory accesses.

- **Batch Rendering:** Multiple rendering operations are batched together to reduce the overhead of GPU command submission.

- **Texture Compression:** Textures used for filters and effects are compressed to reduce memory bandwidth and improve rendering performance.

#### Thermal Management

- **Temperature Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the device's temperature using platform-specific APIs.

- **Throttling:** When the device temperature exceeds a safe threshold, the system automatically throttles media processing by reducing frame rates, lowering processing resolution, or disabling certain effects.

- **User Notification:** Users are notified when thermal throttling is active and advised to let the device cool down.

#### Background Processing

- **Defer Non-Critical Tasks:** Non-critical tasks such as generating thumbnails, applying non-real-time effects, and uploading videos are deferred to times when the device is charging or has sufficient battery.

- **Use Background Tasks API:** Platform-specific background task APIs (e.g., `BGTaskScheduler` on iOS, `WorkManager` on Android) are used to schedule deferred tasks efficiently.

### 2. Enhanced Chat System

Real-time messaging can be power-intensive due to constant network activity and background processing. The following strategies are employed:

#### Efficient WebSocket Management

- **Connection Pooling:** WebSocket connections are pooled and reused to minimize the overhead of establishing new connections.

- **Heartbeat Optimization:** The frequency of WebSocket heartbeat messages is optimized to balance connection stability with battery consumption. Heartbeat intervals are increased when the app is in the background.

- **Adaptive Reconnection:** When a WebSocket connection is lost, the system uses an exponential backoff strategy for reconnection attempts to avoid excessive network activity.

#### Push Notifications

- **Rely on Push Notifications:** When the app is in the background, push notifications (via Firebase Cloud Messaging) are used to alert users of new messages instead of maintaining a persistent WebSocket connection. This significantly reduces battery consumption.

- **Notification Batching:** Multiple notifications are batched together when possible to reduce the number of times the device wakes up.

#### Message Synchronization

- **Incremental Sync:** Only new or updated messages are synchronized, rather than re-downloading the entire message history.

- **Pagination:** Message history is loaded in pages to avoid loading large amounts of data at once.

- **Background Fetch Optimization:** Background fetch is used sparingly and only for critical updates (e.g., new messages from important contacts).

#### Media Handling

- **Lazy Loading:** Media files (images, videos, voice messages) are loaded lazily, only when they are about to be displayed.

- **Thumbnail Caching:** Thumbnails are cached locally to avoid re-downloading them.

- **Media Compression:** Images and videos are compressed before sending to reduce file size and transmission time.

#### Typing Indicators and Presence

- **Debouncing:** Typing indicator updates are debounced to avoid sending excessive network requests. Updates are sent only after the user has stopped typing for a short period (e.g., 500ms).

- **Presence Batching:** Online/offline status updates are batched and sent at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds) rather than immediately upon status change.

### 3. Secure Location Sharing

Location tracking is inherently power-intensive, especially when using GPS. The following strategies are employed:

#### Adaptive Location Updates

- **Battery-Aware Update Frequency:** The frequency of location updates is dynamically adjusted based on the device's battery level:
  - **High Battery (>50%):** Updates every 30 seconds to 1 minute for high accuracy.
  - **Medium Battery (20-50%):** Updates every 2-5 minutes for balanced accuracy and battery life.
  - **Low Battery (<20%):** Updates every 10-15 minutes or only on significant location changes.

- **Movement Detection:** The system uses accelerometer data to detect when the device is stationary. When stationary, location updates are paused or significantly reduced.

- **Sharing Status:** Location tracking is automatically paused when a user is not actively sharing their location with anyone.

#### Background Location Tracking

- **Significant Location Change:** On iOS, the **Significant Location Change** service is used instead of continuous GPS tracking when high precision is not required. This service uses cell tower and Wi-Fi positioning, which consumes significantly less battery than GPS.

- **Geofencing API:** On Android, the **Geofencing API** is used to monitor geofences efficiently. The system only requests location updates when the user enters or exits a geofence, rather than continuously polling GPS.

- **Deferred Location Updates:** On iOS, **Deferred Location Updates** are used to batch location updates and deliver them when the device is in a more power-efficient state.

#### Network-Based Location

- **Prefer Network Location:** When high precision is not required (e.g., for city-level location sharing), network-based location (Wi-Fi, cellular towers) is used instead of GPS, as it consumes significantly less battery.

#### User Control

- **Location Sharing Toggle:** Users can easily toggle location sharing on and off to conserve battery when not needed.

- **Precision Control:** Users can choose the level of location precision to share (exact, approximate, city-level), with lower precision consuming less battery.

### 4. Live Streaming

Live streaming is extremely power-intensive due to continuous video encoding, network transmission, and screen-on time. The following strategies are employed:

#### Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

- **Dynamic Bitrate Adjustment:** The video bitrate is dynamically adjusted based on network conditions and device capabilities. Lower bitrates reduce the computational cost of encoding and the amount of data transmitted, saving battery.

- **Resolution Scaling:** The video resolution is scaled down when battery is low or the device is overheating.

#### Hardware Encoding

- **Use Hardware Encoders:** Hardware video encoders (e.g., **VideoToolbox** on iOS, **MediaCodec** on Android) are used instead of software encoders to significantly reduce CPU usage and battery consumption.

#### Frame Rate Optimization

- **Reduce Frame Rate:** The frame rate is reduced (e.g., from 30 fps to 24 fps or 15 fps) when battery is low or the device is overheating.

#### Screen Brightness

- **Dim Screen:** The system suggests dimming the screen brightness during live streaming to save battery.

#### Network Optimization

- **Efficient Protocols:** Efficient streaming protocols (e.g., **HLS**, **RTMP**) are used to minimize network overhead.

- **Connection Monitoring:** The system monitors network conditions and adjusts streaming parameters accordingly.

### 5. Stories and Reels

Stories and Reels involve video playback, which can be power-intensive. The following strategies are employed:

#### Video Playback Optimization

- **Hardware Decoding:** Hardware video decoders are used to minimize CPU usage during video playback.

- **Preloading:** Videos are preloaded in the background to ensure smooth playback and reduce the need for on-demand loading, which can be power-intensive.

- **Adaptive Quality:** Video quality is automatically adjusted based on network conditions and battery level.

#### Autoplay Control

- **Disable Autoplay on Low Battery:** Video autoplay is automatically disabled when battery is low to conserve power.

- **User Control:** Users can disable video autoplay in settings to save battery.

#### Screen-On Time

- **Encourage Shorter Viewing Sessions:** The UI is designed to encourage shorter viewing sessions, reducing overall screen-on time.

### 6. Notifications

Notifications can wake up the device and trigger background processing, consuming battery. The following strategies are employed:

#### Notification Batching

- **Batch Notifications:** Multiple notifications are batched together when possible to reduce the number of times the device wakes up.

#### Notification Channels (Android)

- **Use Notification Channels:** On Android, notification channels are used to allow users to customize notification behavior (sound, vibration, priority) for different types of notifications, giving them control over battery impact.

#### Silent Notifications

- **Use Silent Notifications:** For non-critical updates, silent notifications (data-only notifications) are used instead of notifications that wake up the device and display a banner.

### 7. Background App Refresh

Background app refresh allows the app to update content in the background, but it can consume battery. The following strategies are employed:

#### Minimize Background Activity

- **Limit Background Tasks:** Background tasks are limited to essential operations (e.g., downloading new messages, updating location).

- **Use Background Task APIs:** Platform-specific background task APIs (`BGTaskScheduler` on iOS, `WorkManager` on Android) are used to schedule background tasks efficiently.

#### Adaptive Background Refresh

- **Adjust Frequency:** The frequency of background app refresh is adjusted based on user behavior and battery level. If a user rarely opens the app, background refresh is reduced.

- **Disable on Low Battery:** Background app refresh is automatically disabled when battery is low.

---

## Platform-Specific Optimizations

### iOS Optimizations

1. **Use Low Power Mode:** Detect when the device is in Low Power Mode and automatically adjust app behavior to minimize battery consumption (e.g., disable autoplay, reduce location update frequency, disable background app refresh).

2. **Background App Refresh:** Respect the user's Background App Refresh settings and use `BGTaskScheduler` for efficient background task scheduling.

3. **Energy Efficient APIs:** Use energy-efficient APIs such as:
