## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Virtual Wallet System

The virtual wallet provides real-time balance tracking for both coins (virtual currency) and cash (creator earnings). Users can view their coin balance for purchasing gifts and creators can monitor their cash balance from gift revenues. The wallet automatically updates in real-time as transactions occur, ensuring accurate balance information at all times.

### 2. Gift Shop & Marketplace

The gift shop features a comprehensive catalog of virtual gifts with varying rarity levels (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary). Each gift includes animated Lottie previews, emoji representations, and coin-based pricing. Gifts range from 10 coins (Heart) to 1000 coins (Rocket), with visual rarity indicators using gradient borders and badges.

**Available Gifts:**
- **Heart** (❤️) - 10 coins - Common
- **Rose** (🌹) - 25 coins - Common
- **Star** (⭐) - 50 coins - Rare

### 3. Creator Revenue Dashboard

Creators have access to a comprehensive dashboard displaying total earnings, monthly earnings, and detailed earning history. The dashboard shows all gift revenues with 60% revenue share going to creators and 40% to the platform. Creators can track individual transactions, view earning trends, and request withdrawals directly from the dashboard.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Total lifetime earnings display
- Monthly earnings tracking
- Transaction-by-transaction history
- Withdrawal request system
- Real-time balance updates

### 4. VIP System & Leaderboard

The VIP system ranks supporters based on total spending, creating a competitive leaderboard. Users are assigned VIP tiers (Diamond, Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on their ranking position. The top 100 supporters are displayed on the global leaderboard with visual badges and tier indicators.

**VIP Tiers:**
- **Diamond** - Top 10 supporters (💎)
- **Gold** - Ranks 11-50 (🥇)
- **Silver** - Ranks 51-100 (🥈)
- **Bronze** - All other supporters (🥉)
