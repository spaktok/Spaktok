## üì± About Spaktok

Spaktok is a modern, feature-rich social media application built with Flutter, offering a unique blend of content creation, live streaming, and social interaction capabilities. Inspired by the best features of TikTok and Snapchat, but with a unique design and innovative features.

### ‚ú® Key Highlights

- üì∏ **Advanced Camera** with professional filters and effects
- üé≠ **AR Filters & Stickers** for creative content
- üíù **Virtual Gifts System** with in-app currency
- üåç **Multi-language Support** (Currently disabled due to `AppLocalizations` issues)
- üîí **Privacy & Security** focused design
- üìä **Real-time Analytics** and engagement metrics
- üé® **Modern UI/UX** with dark theme

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop and implement all features for the Spaktok application, complete Firebase, Agora, and Stripe configurations, and finalize documentation. Android SDK setup has been temporarily deferred.

## Current Status

### Implemented Features

The following features have been implemented and integrated into the application:

*   **AR Shopping**: E-commerce integration with Augmented Reality (AR) product try-on capabilities.
*   **Snap Map**: Location-based map integration for user interaction and content discovery.
*   **Mini-apps**: A framework for integrating in-chat games and small applications.
*   **AI Translation**: Automatic translation for comments and messages to facilitate global communication.
*   **Group Calls**: Multi-participant voice and video call functionality, powered by Agora.
*   **Creator Payouts**: A system for managing creator earnings and facilitating payouts.

### Configurations

*   **Firebase**: Configured for Web, Android, and iOS platforms. This includes Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and other related services. (`firebase_options.dart`, `google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist` are present).
*   **Agora**: Integrated for real-time communication, specifically for live streaming and group calls. The Agora App ID (`a41807bba5c144b5b8e1fd5ee711707b`) and a temporary token have been set in `lib/screens/live_stream_screen.dart`.
*   **Stripe**: Integrated for payment processing, particularly for creator payouts and virtual gifts. The Stripe Secret Key (`YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_HERE`) has been configured as an environment variable in `backend/.env`.

### Known Issues

*   **Android SDK Setup**: The Android SDK setup is currently deferred due to persistent configuration issues. This will be addressed in a later phase, potentially in a different environment.
*   **AppLocalizations**: All direct references to `AppLocalizations` have been removed from the project to resolve compilation errors. This means the application currently lacks internationalization support. This will need to be re-implemented or properly configured if multi-language support is desired.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the Spaktok project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed and configured.
*   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development) - *Note: Android SDK setup is currently deferred.*
*   [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) installed.
*   Access to a Firebase project.
*   Agora App ID and temporary token.
*   Stripe Secret Key.

### Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spaktok/Spaktok.git
    cd Spaktok
    ```

2.  **Install Flutter dependencies**:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase**: Ensure `firebase_options.dart` is correctly generated and `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) are in their respective directories.

4.  **Configure Agora**: The App ID is already set in `lib/screens/live_stream_screen.dart`. Ensure a valid Agora token is used for production.

5.  **Configure Stripe**: Set your Stripe Secret Key as an environment variable in the `backend/.env` file:

    ```
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key_here
    ```

6.  **Build the application** (e.g., for web):

    ```bash
    flutter build web
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the application on a connected device (emulator or physical device):

```bash
flutter run
```

To run the application on the web:

```bash
flutter run -d web
```

To run the application on Linux desktop (after installing prerequisites like `cmake`, `ninja-build`, `clang`, `libgtk-3-dev`):

```bash
flutter run -d linux
```

## Future Work

*   Revisit and resolve Android SDK setup issues.
*   Implement proper internationalization using `AppLocalizations`.
*   Further testing and optimization of all features.
*   Deployment to production environments.
