## 🚧 Current Blockers

### 1. Android SDK Setup ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Status:** BLOCKED  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Attempts:** 20+ installation attempts

**Description:**  
Despite multiple attempts using various methods (manual installation, Android Studio snap, command-line tools), the Android SDK continues to report missing `cmdline-tools` component. This prevents building and testing Android-specific features.

**Affected Features:**
- Native camera with advanced AR filters
- Screenshot notifications
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Full Agora integration testing
- AR Shopping
- Location-based features

**Workaround:**  
Currently focusing on web-compatible features and UI development. All services and business logic are platform-agnostic and will work once Android SDK is properly configured.

**Recommendation:**  
User assistance may be required to:
1. Provide access to a pre-configured Android development environment
2. Share working Android SDK installation scripts
3. Consider using cloud-based Android build services (e.g., Codemagic, Bitrise)

---

### 2. Firebase Configuration ⚠️

**Status:** PENDING  
**Impact:** MEDIUM

**Required:**
- Firebase project setup
- `firebase_options.dart` generation
- Firebase Authentication configuration
- Firestore security rules
- Storage bucket configuration

**Current State:**  
Project structure is ready, but Firebase needs to be initialized with actual credentials.

---

### 3. Agora Configuration ⚠️

**Status:** PENDING  
**Impact:** HIGH

**Required:**
- Agora App ID
- Agora App Certificate
- Token generation server (Firebase Function or backend API)
- Testing credentials

**Current State:**  
Agora integration code is complete, but requires valid credentials for testing.

---

### 4. Stripe Configuration ⚠️

**Status:** PENDING  
**Impact:** MEDIUM

**Required:**
- Stripe Publishable Key
- Stripe Secret Key
- Webhook endpoint setup
- Payment method configuration

**Current State:**  
Stripe integration code is complete, but requires valid API keys for testing.
